# Event Management System Conversion - Progress Summary

## What's Been Done

### Database Configuration
- Created `data.sql` with database initialization for event management system
- Updated environment variable to use `event_management_nra` database name
- Emptied migrations folder to prepare for fresh TypeORM migrations

### Entity Structure
- Defined core domain entities for the event management system:
  - Event - Main entity for event information (name, date, location, etc.)
  - EventType - For categorizing different types of events
  - EventNote - For storing notes related to events
  - Gift - For managing gifts inventory
  - EventGift - For associating gifts with events
  - Class - For managing location/rooms
  - Student - Transformed to represent event participants
  - Teacher - Transformed to represent event organizers

### React Admin UI
- Created entity definition files for all new entities in `client/src/entities/`
- Updated `student.jsx` and `teacher.jsx` to match server-side entity structure
- Updated `App.jsx` to:
  - Import the new entity components
  - Register them as resources with appropriate icons
  - Organize them into logical menu groups ("events" and "data")
  - Remove unnecessary educational system resources
- Updated `domainTranslations.js` with Hebrew labels for all event-related entities

## Current Focus: Cleanup & Schema Migration

We are currently focusing on:
1. **Removing Unused Entities**:
   - Deleting entity files that are not needed for the event management system
   - Cleaning up entity module configurations
   - Removing view entities related to the educational system
   - Ensuring all imports and references are updated

2. **Docker Environment Setup**:
   - Running Docker containers to verify system works with new entity structure
   - Note: Docker environment must be running before TypeORM migrations can be executed

3. **TypeORM Migrations**:
   - Generating initial TypeORM migrations based on entity definitions
   - Applying migrations to create the database schema
   - Verifying database structure matches entity definitions

All changes are being tracked with Git commits at each major step to maintain a clear history of the conversion process.

## Future Steps

1. **Data Access & Business Logic**:
   - Implement any required custom controllers or services for event-specific logic
   - Create any necessary server-side validation rules

2. **UI Customization & Reports**:
   - Update Dashboard to show event-related statistics
   - Create any special event-related reports or dashboards
   - Add custom views for event registration or management

3. **User Interface Refinements**:
   - Test and refine user flows for event management
   - Add any missing relationships between entities 
   - Create specialized edit/create forms for complex operations

4. **Testing & Deployment**:
   - Test all CRUD operations on all entities
   - Ensure validation rules work correctly
   - Prepare deployment configuration

The system has been successfully transformed from an educational tracking system to an event management system. The core entity structure is in place, and the React Admin UI has been updated to match the new domain. After completing the current cleanup and migration steps, we will focus on implementing additional business logic and finalizing the user interface.
