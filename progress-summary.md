# Event Management System Conversion - Progress Summary

## What's Been Done

### Database Configuration
- Created `data.sql` with database initialization for event management system
- Updated environment variable to use `event_management_nra` database name
- Emptied migrations folder to prepare for fresh TypeORM migrations

### Entity Structure
- Defined core domain entities for the event management system:
  - Event - Main entity for event information (name, date, location, etc.)
  - EventType - For categorizing different types of events
  - EventNote - For storing notes related to events
  - Gift - For managing gifts inventory
  - EventGift - For associating gifts with events
  - Class - For managing location/rooms
  - Student - Transformed to represent event participants
  - Teacher - Transformed to represent event organizers

### React Admin UI
- Created entity definition files for all new entities in `client/src/entities/`
- Updated `student.jsx` and `teacher.jsx` to match server-side entity structure
- Updated `App.jsx` to:
  - Import the new entity components
  - Register them as resources with appropriate icons
  - Organize them into logical menu groups ("events" and "data")
  - Remove unnecessary educational system resources
- Updated `domainTranslations.js` with Hebrew labels for all event-related entities

### Entity Cleanup (Completed)
- Removed unused educational system entity files from:
  - Client-side entity definitions (removed 15 .jsx files)
  - Server-side entity module configurations (removed entity module config files)
- Kept all shared entity files intact as they contain reusable components
- Git committed all cleanup changes to maintain a clear history

### Docker Environment Setup (Completed)
- Successfully running Docker containers with the new entity structure
- Verified system operation in containerized environment
- Configured environment variables for Docker deployment

### Database Schema Migration (Completed)
- Generated initial TypeORM migrations based on entity definitions
- Applied migrations to create the database schema
- Verified database structure matches entity definitions
- Created necessary indexes and relations

### Dashboard Customization (Completed)
- Updated `settingsUtil.js` to provide event-focused default dashboard items:
  - Upcoming events card with date filtering
  - Participants (students) count card
  - Event gifts count card
  - Event notes count card
- Enhanced dashboard component with:
  - Upcoming events table showing the next 5 scheduled events with details
  - Event statistics section with cards for popular gifts, venues, and organizers
- Updated dashboard configuration to include all event entities as options
- Removed year-based filtering where not applicable to events
- Created direct links to event details and event creation

## Current Focus: Event-Related Reports

We are currently focusing on:
1. **Event-Related Reports**:
   - Creating specialized reports for event management
   - Implementing event registration and attendance tracking views
   - Developing gift management reporting

2. **Data Access & Business Logic**:
   - Implementing custom controllers or services for event-specific logic
   - Creating necessary server-side validation rules

All changes are being tracked with Git commits at each major step to maintain a clear history of the conversion process.

## Future Steps

1. **User Interface Refinements**:
   - Test and refine user flows for event management
   - Add any missing relationships between entities 
   - Create specialized edit/create forms for complex operations

2. **Testing & Deployment**:
   - Test all CRUD operations on all entities
   - Ensure validation rules work correctly
   - Prepare deployment configuration

The system has been successfully transformed from an educational tracking system to an event management system. The core entity structure is in place, and the React Admin UI has been updated to match the new domain. With Docker setup, database migrations, and dashboard customization complete, we are now focused on developing specialized reports and business logic for comprehensive event management.
