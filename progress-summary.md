# Event Management System Conversion - Progress Summary

## What's Been Done

### Database Configuration
- Created `data.sql` with database initialization for event management system
- Updated environment variable to use `event_management_nra` database name
- Emptied migrations folder to prepare for fresh TypeORM migrations

### Entity Structure
- Defined core domain entities for the event management system:
  - Event - Main entity for event information (name, date, location, etc.)
  - EventType - For categorizing different types of events
  - EventNote - For storing notes related to events
  - Gift - For managing gifts inventory
  - EventGift - For associating gifts with events
  - Class - For managing location/rooms
  - Student - Transformed to represent event participants
  - Teacher - Transformed to represent event organizers

### React Admin UI
- Created entity definition files for all new entities in `client/src/entities/`
- Updated `student.jsx` and `teacher.jsx` to match server-side entity structure
- Updated `App.jsx` to:
  - Import the new entity components
  - Register them as resources with appropriate icons
  - Organize them into logical menu groups ("events" and "data")
  - Remove unnecessary educational system resources
- Updated `domainTranslations.js` with Hebrew labels for all event-related entities

## Next Steps

1. **TypeORM Migrations**:
   - Generate initial TypeORM migrations based on entity definitions
   - Apply migrations to create the database schema

2. **Data Access & Business Logic**:
   - Implement any required custom controllers or services for event-specific logic
   - Create any necessary server-side validation rules

3. **UI Customization & Reports**:
   - Update Dashboard to show event-related statistics
   - Create any special event-related reports or dashboards
   - Add custom views for event registration or management

4. **User Interface Refinements**:
   - Test and refine user flows for event management
   - Add any missing relationships between entities 
   - Create specialized edit/create forms for complex operations

5. **Testing & Deployment**:
   - Test all CRUD operations on all entities
   - Ensure validation rules work correctly
   - Prepare deployment configuration

The system has been successfully transformed from an educational tracking system to an event management system. The core entity structure is in place, and the React Admin UI has been updated to match the new domain. The next steps involve implementing TypeORM migrations, adding any additional business logic, and finalizing the user interface.
