## Implementation Notes

### Current Flow Overview
The current flow in `yemot-handler.ts` follows these steps:
1. Student identification
2. Event type selection
3. Event date selection
4. Check if event exists
5. Level type selection (currently allows editing existing events)
6. Gift selection (up to 3)
7. Save event
8. End call with success message

### New Flow Overview
The new flow will:
1. Present main menu with 4 options
2. Based on selection, route to appropriate handler
3. Prevent editing of existing events (provide phone number instead)
4. Update terminology (Level Types ‚Üí Paths, Gifts ‚Üí Vouchers)
5. Add confirmation steps for selections
6. Allow post-event status updates
7. Provide context-specific success messages
8. Allow multiple operations in a single call

## Technical Details

- Related handlers that will need updates:
  - `student-handler.ts`
  - `event-existence-handler.ts`
  - `level-type-handler.ts` (rename to path-handler.ts)
  - `gift-handler.ts` (rename to voucher-handler.ts)
